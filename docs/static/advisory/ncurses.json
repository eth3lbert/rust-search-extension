      "description": "`ncurses` exposes functions from the ncurses library which:\n\n- Pass buffers without length to C functions that may write an arbitrary amount of\n  data, leading to a buffer overflow. (`instr`, `mvwinstr`, etc)\n- Passes rust &str to strings expecting C format arguments, allowing hostile\n  input to execute a format string attack, which trivially allows writing\n  arbitrary data to stack memory (functions in the `printw` family).",
