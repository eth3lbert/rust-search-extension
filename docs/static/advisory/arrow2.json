      "description": "The struct `Ffi_ArrowArray` implements `#derive(Clone)` that is inconsistent with\nits custom implementation of `Drop`, resulting in a double free when cloned.\n\nCloning this struct in `safe` results in a segmentation fault, which is unsound.\n\nThis derive was removed from this struct. All users are advised to either:\n* bump the patch version of this crate (for versions `v0.7,v0.8,v0.9`), or\n* migrate to a more recent version of  the crate (when using `<0.7`).\n\nDoing so elimitates this vulnerability (code no longer compiles).",
