The pointer is\ncommonly unaligned in practice, resulting in undefined behavior.\n\nIn some build modes, this is observable as a panic followed by abort. In other\nbuild modes the UB may manifest in some other way, including the possibility of\nworking correctly in some architectures.\n\nThe crate is not currently maintained, so a patched version is not available.\n\n## Recommended alternatives\n- [`uzers`](https://crates.io/crates/uzers) (an actively maintained fork of the `users` crate)\n- [`sysinfo`](https://crates.io/crates/sysinfo)",
